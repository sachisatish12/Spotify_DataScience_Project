# Description of Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs <br>
This dataset contains information about 28,356 songs on Spotify that are in playlists that are reported to be 5 different genres (pop, r&b, latin, rap, and edm). 
We want to be able to predict the genre of a playlist a song is in based on data about the song including danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, valence, and tempo. These variables are described below. 

# Exploratory Data Analytics
## Variables:
- Danceability
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
  - Some genres might be considered more ‘danceable’ than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on how ‘danceable’ a track is considered to be.
- Energy
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
  - Some genres might be considered more energetic than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on how energetic a track is considered to be.
- Key
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
  - Some genres might use one key more than other genres. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on what key a song is in. 
- Loudness
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
  - Some genres might be louder than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on how loud a track is. 
- Speechiness
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
  - Some genres might contain more spoken words than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on the ‘speechiness’ of a track. 
- Acousticness
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
  - Some genres might be more likely to be acoustic than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on the acoustic confidence of a track. 
- Instrumentalness
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
  - Some genres might contain more instrumentals than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on the ‘instrumentalness’ of a track. 
- Valence
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
  - Some genres might be considered more positive than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on the valence of a track. 
- Tempo 
  - Double
  - Quantitative variable
  - The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
  - Some genres could tend to have a faster tempo than others. We may be able to predict the genre of the playlist a song is in depending on the tempo of a track. 
- Playlist_genre 
  - Character
  - Categorical variable
  - The genre of the playlist of the song
  - This is how we will be able to determine genre.

## Summary Statistics:
- Mean
  - Determine the typical value for specific features, helping to identify genre-specific features 
- Median 
  - Provide a central value that isn’t as heavily affected by outliers, helping to identify genre-specific features 
- Standard deviation 
  - Used to determine how spread our or concentrated a specific variable is within genres 
- Min and max value
  - Provide range
  - Show the boundaries of our variables and how they differ from one another between genres 
- Q1 and Q3
  - We can determine where most of a variable falls
  - Help us understand the distribution of data
  - Can determine if certain variables have concentrated values within a certain range
  - We can determine the typical range of each variable in each genre which can be helpful for predictions 

## Types of Figures to Plot:
There may be multiple versions of each figure (one for each genre/variable) depending on the type of figure. These figures will help us visualize the effect a variable may have on the genre of the playlist. 
- Scatter plot 
  - Including line of fit
  - Can be used to determine if there is a correlation between x variable and genre
  - We will compare the scatterplots to each other
- Histogram 
  - Can be used to see how the data is distributed and determine if there is a skew 
  - There will be 9 figures, one for each variable. They will be compared to each genre 
  - Mean or median of variables vs genre 
- Bar chart 
  - We can compare the average tempo, valence, etc. for each of the five genres
  - Mean or median of variables vs genre 
- Pie chart 
  - Can be used to see what genres are most likely when x variable is (for example) above 0.75, etc
  - Can help us determine if there is a correlation between certain variables and genre
- Radar chart 
  - Can feature multiple quantitative variables at the same time
  - Each corner will be a variable and each color will represent the genre 


# Models 
- Logistic Regression  
  - Will let us quickly be able to tell which variables are strong predictors of genre
  - Calculates the probability of each genre by modeling the relationship between the variables and the genre classes
  - Allows us to see how each variable contributes to the prediction 
- Neural Network 
  - Mechanism: Composed of layers of interconnected neurons, each layer transforms input data in complex ways to detect intricate patterns.
  - High Dimensional Data: Neural networks excel with high-dimensional data by capturing complex relationships across multiple features.
  - Non-linear Relationships: Neural networks are powerful for datasets with non-linear patterns, as they can learn and model intricate dependencies between features (like tempo, energy, etc.) and targets (genres).
  - Handling Noise: They perform well with noisy data by adjusting weights during training to focus on meaningful patterns and ignore irrelevant noise.
  - Overfitting Prevention: With techniques like dropout and regularization, neural networks reduce overfitting, which is particularly useful when training on large datasets of varying songs.
  - Suitability for Categorical Targets: Neural networks are well-suited for multi-class classification, making them effective for predicting categorical targets such as genres
  - This makes neural networks a strong choice for accurately predicting song genres based on complex musical attributes.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
  - Can separate classes 
  - SVM can distinguish between genres based on song features/variables 
  - SVM can use different kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships 
  - Linear, polynomial, radial basis function
  - Beneficial for complex datasets 
  - Finds an optimal line that maximizes distances between each class 
- K Nearest Numbers Classifier 
  - Relatively accurate for its simplicity.
  - Alongside feature selection, can be adjusted with different k values and choosing either uniform or distance-based weights for each neighbor.
  - Does not perform well with many dimensions; therefore, should try to reduce the number of features used to lower the dimensions.
  - Prone to overfitting with low values of k, and to underfitting with very large k values.
- Random Forest Classifier  
  - Combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy 
  - works well with high dimensional data (datasets with many features)
  - The features in our dataset likely have non linear relationships, and random forest classifiers are good at finding non linear patterns
  - random forest classifiers are good at handling outliers and noise, which can be prevalent in a dataset with so many datapoints, and about songs as they can vary widely
  - random forest classifiers have a lower risk of overfitting than individual decision trees since they aggregate predictions of multiple decision trees
  - random forest classifiers are known to work well with categorical targets (genres in our case)

# Evaluation Metrics
We will be evaluating our models by assessing these metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores, and confusion matrix. 
By evaluating these metrics, we will be able to tell how accurately the different variables are at predicting the genre of the playlist.
